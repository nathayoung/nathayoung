# Good Morning!

Hi, I'm Nathan Young.  Currently, I work as an IT Engineer at [Hitachi Astemo](https://www.hitachiastemo.com/en/) at the Findlay, OH location.  My main role here is writing reports using SSRS and other tools to help the business understand it's data better.  I also help support production software among various other daily tasks. 

While I am not at work, I am studying to earn my [MBA in Business Data Analytics](https://www.mvnu.edu/gps/graduateprograms/mba-businessdataanalytics) from [Mount Vernon Nazarene University](https://www.mvnu.edu/).  Here, I plan to grow my knowledge in not only business, but also data analytics and thus aid my current employer and potential future employers with not only reports, but also the ability to provide beneficial feedback and plans as the business world becomes increasingly agile.

Feel free to check out any of the links below to learn more about me or see what I am working on outside of work and school.
